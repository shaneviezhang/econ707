Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP): scale, zonal, gerymandering/redistricting - https://gisgeography.com/maup-modifiable-areal-unit-problem/
- Effect of some policy on crime: luminosity on crime
	Crime Counts: within an area (corner, block, neighborhood (?), county, state)
	Whether a crime happens: need interactions
	Use CI (and counterfactuals) to inform this
- Effect of pavement smoothness on crash rates
	How should we design a study?
	mile level? between exits? routes? route-by-county? grid?
- Generate random points and polygons
	multiple geometries

Tobler's First Law of Geography:
"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
	- disease spread
	- pollution
	- legal marijuana

Autocorrelation: correlation between "nearby" observations

This leads to:
	- OLS
		- crime here is caused by unemployment here
	- spatial lag in x
		- crime here is impacted by unemployment here and there
		- not necessarily a spatial model
	- spatial error (error terms are related)
		Y_i = X_i \beta + e_i + \lambda w_i e
		"... the only way that observations are interdependent is through unmeasured variables that are correlated, in this case across space." - Space Is More than Geography: Using Spatial Econometrics in the Study of Political Economy
		"the error of an observation affects the errors of its neighbors" - https://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/spatial_error_1
		there is some unobserved factor across space impacting
	- spatial lag (observations are spatially dependent)
		Y_i = X_i \beta + \lambda w_i y + e_i
		- should be thought of as spillovers
			- a higher income in one county increases income in another
		"... differs from the spatially lagged error model, in that both the error term and the covariates in nearby units impact the current unit"
		"... let the dependent variable be the level of democracy in a country. It is likely that this is partly a function of democracy in nearby countries, rather than just being related to common unmeasured variables in nearby countries."
		WHAT ARE COMMON UNMEASURED VARIABLES IN NEARBY COUNTRIES?
		ex: (n) -- 
		ex: (y) -- 
		This can also be thought on in a non-spatial sense.
			What about Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat?  These are "closer" than J&J, Eli Lilly, Pfizer.
	- spatial heterogeneity (model params vary over space)
		ex: (n) -- 
		ex: (y) -- 

We need a weights matrix!
	- create connections
	- rook vs queen vs k-nearest vs decaying

Moran's I (-1 to 1)
- build formula ...
1) Compute mean: \bar{X}
2) Compute variation: \sum_{i = 1}^{N} (X_i - \bar{X})^2
3) Compute weighted variation... variation between units weighted by "closeness"/"nearness"
	- for each i, for each j, calculate (X_i - \bar{X})(X_j - \bar{X}) ... similar to correlation
	- weight this by w! w(X_i - \bar{X})(X_j - \bar{X})
4) Step 3 / Step 2
	Don't usually have negative, so often testing if I > some critical value

Models:
- lag
- error
